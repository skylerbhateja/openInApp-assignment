About OpeninApp 
Almost all your favorite creators on Instagram, share links to their latest Youtube videos or Youtube channels in their bio or stories. But whenever you tap on those links, you get redirected to the youtube website instead of the youtube app. And here you can’t watch the video in full screen nor can you like it, comment on it or subscribe to the channel. 
Ever wondered why it is so? That’s because Instagram has something called a Built—IN-Browser that opens up instead of opening the app you wanted to open. Which is not cool at all ... .And this is not just so for IG but for all your favorite social media apps eg.Youtube, Linkedin, Twitter, Snapchat, Telegram, Quora etc.. 
So we fixed this problem of sub-optimal user experiences by building a tool that ensures all social media links open in the apps they should. It’s called OpeninApp. And it is already loved by over 1.5 Million influencers & brands including the likes of Munawar Faruqui, Raj Shamani, Riva Arora, Aishwarya (Ranjnikant-ji’s daughter), trak-in Tech, Mamaearth etc.. And has been used by 55Mn+ users. 
So if you are someone who is passionate about social media and wants to improve User Experiences for a Billion people, then welcome home.a Billion people, then welcome home…
